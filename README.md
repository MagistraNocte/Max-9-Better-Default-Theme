# Max 9 Better Default Theme
Cleaner and easier-on-the-eyes version of the "default" theme of [Max 9](http://cycling74.com/products/max/).
The default theme of max 9 has very dark background objects on a brighter patcher background, I think the opposite looks better, cleaner, easier on the eyes and easier to read, that's what this theme is doing, somewhat combining Max 9's default theme with Max 8's:

Brighter objects and cables on a darker patcher background, instead of the opposite (this is a better dark mode, after all, the majority of a patch is empty space!).

All color hues stay the same, only brightness is changed, and all the brightness relationships between colors are mantained, only transposed up or down. Every color that is not related to what's inside the patcher window (objects, cables, and the background) is unchanged (such as sidebars interfaces, toolbars, menus, etc. Default syntax highlight also stay the same and can be independently changed with the appropriate setting).

## Installation instructions:

Download the `Better Default Theme` folder and put it in the `Packages` folder located in the Max library.

Now you can select the `better-default` theme in Max preferences (`Color and Theme > Color Theme`), it will be applied to the whole program (not just a single patcher) like any other default installed theme. Please note: like all other themes, this only affects the current computer Max is installed on.
